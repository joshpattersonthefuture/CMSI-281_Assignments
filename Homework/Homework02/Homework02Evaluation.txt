Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Minimal testing on your Queue class.  You should always write
more tests.  There is no such thing as "too much testing".  Test
as much as you can, the more you test the more likely it is you
will find more bugs or errors in your programs!  In your stack
program, your peek() method is NOT looking at the top, since it
returns what was pushed first, not last.
