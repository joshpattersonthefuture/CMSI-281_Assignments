Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

A couple of comments:

You didn't rename the methods push and pop as was specified in
the assignment.  They should have been "enqueue" and "dequeue"
or something similar.

When I run your code, I get an immediate NullPointerException, so
I can't really evaluate your code properly.  Your test coverage
seems adequate based on inspecting the code, but you can always
do more testing.
