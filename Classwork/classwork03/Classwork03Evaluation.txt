Classwork03 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

+ your code doesn't compile, there are a total of four
   errors when I run javac; you should make sure your
   code COMPILES when you commit it.  If you are using an
   IDE, I have said several times in class that you need to
   make sure it compiles MANUALLY because that's the way I
   do the evaluations.
+ your code looks nice, but doesn't compile so there is no
   way for me to evaluate it...
+ it seems you are using an "EmptyListException" but there
   is no definition for that class, and no class with that
   name in your repo
